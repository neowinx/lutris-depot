# lutris-depot
A series of work in progress installers for Lutris (https://lutris.net/)

## Run an intaller
As per documentation in [github.com/lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris#command-line-options)
to test an installer, just type something like:

```bash
$ lutris -i YOUR_INSTALLER_NAME.yaml
```

replacing the somewhat obvious YOUR_INSTALLER_NAME.yaml with the name of the yaml of to the installer you want to try

## Have Fun
